This is the user manual for createRemote, an application that allows 
users to remotely control iCreate by entering commands.


=== use existing executables ===
1) Running client and server on same machine:

In two different terminals, run the executables in order
 ./createRemoteServer
 ./createRemoteClient

2) Running on different machines on a LAN network:

First we need to find out the IP address of the server. 
On the server machine, type this bash command:

 ifconfig  | grep 'inet addr:'| grep -v '127.0.0.1' |
 cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'

sample output: 
 1.229.145.71

Next start the server by calling the server executable:
 ./createRemoteServer

On the client machine, run the client executable with the server's
IP address as an argument:
 ./createRemoteClient <server_IP_addr>
 

===compile from source code===

If you have downloaded the source code of this project, to compile
the executables, type
 make

This should build executables createRemoteClient and createRemoteServer
