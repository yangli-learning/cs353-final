This is the user manual for using the precompiled executable createVision,
a server application that plans the motion of iCreate using computer vision. 

The corresponding client application is ../createRemote/createRemoteClient.

The following instruction explains how to use both executables:


=== Usage ===
1) Check whether the webcam is working properly. In Ubuntu, we test webcam 
using gstreamer:
 gstreamer-properties

In the popup window, switch to Video tab, and select the appropriate webcam
name in the Default Input::Divice drop down menu. Then click "Test". This will
display the current camera view.

2) Make sure the client and the server computer are on a shared network, e.g
wireless LAN. Find out the IP address of the server. On the server machine, 
type this bash command:
 ifconfig  | grep 'inet addr:'| grep -v '127.0.0.1' |
 cut -d: -f2 | awk '{ print $1}'

Sample output:
 1.229.145.71

The client program will use this IP address to initiate connection to the
 server.

3) Start the server program:
 ./createVision

A GUI window will pop up and displays the webcam view in two panels.

4) Place the iCreate under the view of the webcam, connect the iCreate USB 
to the netbook, and turn iCreate on.

5) On the netbook(client computer), go to createRemote/ directory and
run the client program with the server's IP addresss as an argument.
 ./createRemoteClient <server_IP_address>

Now the client program receives commands from the server program, and starts
moving towards the predefined target on the server GUI window.

The robot will stop once it is within a range of the target point.
Try clicking at other places in the GUI window to make the robot move in
the specified direction.

6) To stop the application from the GUI, press ESC button. This stops the
client program as well. Do not disconnect the camera USB while the server
program is running, since this may cause segmentation faults that may 
corrupt the webcam files.
